# Impression-of-view 
>by Lynn

This library is used to summarize my personal feelings about the **novels, essays and various literary works** that I have read.

Among them, there are quite a few **literary masterpieces**, and there are also **online novels** that I have read. I don't think literary works should be labeled with all kinds of tags. A work that truly touches my heart and gives me something to gain is a good piece of art.

At the same time, as I became acutely aware of the decline in my writing skills during the previous period, these post-viewing reflections also served as a practice for my expression ability. So that I won't become a mechanized research machine. While expressing my feelings, I also make subjective evaluations of the quality of the work. Maybe one day in the future, my viewpoint will conflict with the current one. But this is not it either - isn't it a kind of progress and development?
