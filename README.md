# Impression-of-view 
>by Lynn

This library is used to summarize my personal feelings about the **novels, essays and various literary works** that I have read.

Among them, there are quite a few **literary masterpieces**, and there are also **online novels** that I have read. I don't think literary works should be labeled with all kinds of tags. A work that truly touches my heart and gives me something to gain is a good piece of art.
